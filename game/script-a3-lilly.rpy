"Graduation from Yamaku is distant enough to be difficult to view objectively, and I've spent so much time in this small room. I've come to accept the dormitory as my new home surprisingly quickly."

hi "I guess that would be hard to deal with. Is your knowledge of English holding up?"

li "Thankfully. I may be fluent, but being in a position where I have to use it often helps in curbing my Japanese accent, so it's been useful practice."

li "I hear you're trying to teach yourself English?"

hi "More like memorizing a few lines, and failing at even that much. I'm really not cut out for learning another language."

"My admission of defeat draws an amused giggle."

li "I believe that there are things one chooses to do in life, and also things that are chosen for one to do in life."

li "You can take comfort in the fact you're better than me in science and math, at least."

li "I wouldn't worry about it. They're useful skills for many jobs, right?"

hi "That's what he tells me. His face veritably lit up when I said I'd probably go into a career involving either."

"As she trails off, I look back to her. My eyes narrow as I see her slightly reddened cheeks and small grin, her mind obviously elsewhere."

hi "Say it."

li "I… knew the possibility of it happening… was there."

hi "I knew it. You're just as dirty-minded as I am."

"She quickly coughs into her free hand, making her disapproval crystal clear."

hi "Oh? And you would suggest?"

li "I merely have a healthy adolescent sex drive."

hi "So in other words, dirty-minded."

"Almost seeming to sense the moment, Hanako mumbles quietly as she furrows her brow in Lilly's lap."

"Lilly's look of disapproval melts away as she gently smiles and strokes her hand on Hanako's long, dark hair."

"All I can do is watch. Watch and smile."

"If someone were to ask me when I fell in love with her, I wouldn't be able to answer. The best I'd be able to come up with is 'it just happened at some point, but I didn't realize it.'"

"If someone were to ask me why I love her, though, then I could answer much more easily."

hi "You really love Hanako, don't you?"

"She gives a self-deprecating sigh."

li "I think I merely provided her with company and support. Since she came to know you she's opened up much more, even to me."

"I get the feeling she's understating her influence on Hanako, especially given that before the two came to know each other, Hanako had no friends to speak of."

"The friends I'd had in my previous school fulfilled what I'd have expected of them, for the most part simply being there for idle chatter, but in Hanako and Lilly there really feels to be more to their relationship."

"A part of me envies it, but another can't ignore the fact that the school year will eventually end. After graduation, I really have no idea what Hanako will do. This trip has shown me just how much we've all come to depend on one another."

"Indeed, we're all going to have to make decisions. Maybe that's the reason why, despite our return to school also heralding a return to the normalcy of everyday life, I can't help feeling a little restless."

"I can't say I disagree with her. The exams had completely slipped my mind for a while now, and even though I may score well on most of our tests, I can't assume that I can pass easily with so little studying beforehand."

"Lilly does seem more studious, or at least more regimented, than me. That said, she has to contend with doing rather badly in some subjects no matter how much she tries."
