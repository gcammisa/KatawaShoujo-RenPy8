n "\nWell, that's what I'd like to think, anyway."

n "\nTo tell the truth, the atmosphere of the entire class, no, the entire school has changed."

n "While an undercurrent of subdued trepidation had previously pervaded the class, now that the exams are in sight it's boiled over into frantic studying rarely seen otherwise."

n "One day until exams start. It's horrific, really, that instead of studying we went and wasted our time up north. We were such model students, too."

"I can't help feeling that my assumption that we could all happily while away our days, having fun in this isolated little world, is coming to an end. It's unsettling."

"I look at Lilly, mildly surprised that she hasn't told me such a thing despite usually being so forthcoming."

"She continues to walk with her face fixedly pointed ahead. I can't read her expression, nor can I even guess what's on her mind, which is discomforting given how it's usually easy for me to do both."

"It reminds me of the time when we met at the Shanghai, just before what could be called our first date. At the time, all I could do was comfort her without knowing the cause, and now feels no different."

"Her whimpering sounds turn to moans as she fills with the same pleasure as I. I can feel my heart beating loudly in my chest, and her own beating underneath my hand."

"The snap of my mobile phone's closing contrasts with the ambient chatter and noise audible even in the hallway outside the library."

"It's the first day of the summer holidays. A time that had perpetually seemed so far away, and yet it's now not only here but also made painfully obvious by the students, or lack thereof, left in the school."

"Most students have returned home to spend the holidays with relatives by now. The few that are left are mostly chatting between themselves, usually about what they intend to do in the coming weeks."

"It makes me feel like the odd one out, for taking advantage of the school library being open for the first several days of the holidays."

"Ostensibly it's for students to drop off any books they've borrowed and have yet to return, and for those who'll have their parents pick them up, to help pass the time until they get whisked away."

"Thanks to the recent lengthy phone call from my parents, which had so rudely woken me from my sleeping on a beanbag at the back of the library, I'm now in the latter category."

"Sliding my phone back into my pocket, this time remembering to set it to silent, I go back into the quiet and wholly placid room."

n "\nA strange word. A foreign, alien one. One that you don't want to be in the same room with."

n "A rare condition. It causes the heart to act erratically and occasionally beat way too fast. It can be fatal."

nvl clear

n "\n'It was a miracle that you were able to go on so long without anything happening,' they said."

n "And then, it did. My condition had taken away everything; my old school was of no importance any more. My home was reduced to a faraway place. Both my friends and my first love simply stopped visiting after a length of time."

n "I became cynical and embittered. Distant and subdued. In my defense, no person could avoid that after such a thing happening to them, but nonetheless I left the hospital as a very definitely changed person."

n "Things changed. I made new friends in Hanako, Shizune and Misha. I found a new sense of 'home' in my dormitory, a new interest in science and the world around me, and I found a direction to my life that I had never felt before."

n "\nBut I'd also discovered other things."

n "The sense of isolation in Yamaku and its surrounds was not entirely unwelcome, the quiet giving a peace of mind I might not have found elsewhere, but it gave the area a feeling of being pushed out of the way, of being kept out of sight."

n "\n\nPeople in the streets would sometimes glance awkwardly, or quickly turn their heads as they realized they were staring. Even if my condition wasn't visible, my uniform was."

n "Even if it weren't, I was still different. I took seventeen pills a day, morning, midday and night. My scar, though hidden behind clothing, was still a permanent mark of my condition. And most of all, there was the very real possibility of death."

n "A bad fall. An absentminded hard hit on the back. A simple sprint taken too far. Anything could have set my heart off, and several times I teetered on the edge of the abyss even with all the care I took of myself."

n "\nBut that was fine. I could have lived with all that."

n "Because there was one final thing I'd found, or rather refound, after entering Yamaku."

n "\nWhich was once again snatched away before my eyes."

nvl clear

n "\nIt's only now that I realize just how delicate my newfound sense of happiness was. Everything depended on her, the linchpin of my life since I first entered Yamaku as a sullen, confused and aimless transfer student."

n "Lilly Satou was the one person I could depend upon above all others, and who reciprocated the love that I felt for her. But I failed her, and only realized it all too late."

n "I thought that I could just set my life up and continue that way forever, but the real world doesn't work like that. I finally realized the meaning of those words, only to be struck down as I confronted my failure to do so in time."

n "\n…"

n "\nThe surroundings I'm in now are all too familiar. It's as if Yamaku was but a dream, and I'm still recovering from my first major heart attack."

"His quick glance to my bed end, to verify my name, shows that his documents obviously didn't have it written on them."

"I give a somewhat dazed reply, most likely the one he'd expect, before really thinking about what I'm saying."

"I slowly shake my head, not wanting to dislodge any pipes or cause myself any more discomfort than necessary. The doctor politely puts down his clipboard in response."

hi "I guess my main question is… what exactly happened?"

"Doctor" "To put it simply, you've unfortunately had another heart attack. While not as severe as your first, you were very lucky it occurred so close to a hospital."

"Doctor" "After being stabilized, you were taken to the operating room. What followed was keyhole surgery in order to insert a temporary pacemaker."

"Doctor" "All in all, the incident happened two days ago, with emergency treatment being carried out very soon afterward. Since then, we've kept you under close observation while you were asleep."

hi "Will I be all right? Are there any lasting problems?"

"Doctor" "Compared to the procedure carried out for your first heart attack, this was relatively minor."

"Doctor" "While you will have to undergo surgery once more in a few days' time to remove the pacemaker, assuming there are no complications, there should be no lasting implications."

"He continues talking, the subject shifting to a repetition of facts about arrhythmia and my medications that I already know for the most part. I start to nod and feign interest, while my mind drifts."

"I begin to think about how perfectly hung the inoffensive painting hanging on the wall behind his shoulder is, and how neat and sterile the surroundings are, even including the doctor himself."

"Doctor" "If my mumbling bores you, you are quite welcome to say so, Mr. Nakai. Lord knows, I lose track of myself sometimes."

"He gives a short chuckle at his self-deprecating joke as I grimace awkwardly, having been rather badly caught out."

"The doctor's chuckle sounds different from that of the nurse at Yamaku though, come to think of it. As I ponder why, I realize why the man in front of me feels just that little bit 'off'."

"His smile is neat and sterile. He delivers his little joke perfectly, with a customary inoffensive chuckle."

"It is like, rather than talking to the man whose name is neatly printed on the nametag pinned to his lab coat, I'm merely interacting with an actor reading off a prerehearsed script, every action having been choreographed beforehand."

"I suppose he has to be this way though, being a doctor."

"He has to keep his neat and sterile smile when chatting to the girl with cancer slowly spreading through her body, when reassuring the woman who'll surely die from childbirth, and with every other terminally and critically ill patient."

"That little bit of distance. That little bit of aloofness."

"It makes me wonder if I've been too harsh, especially considering it's a disposition far from being adopted only by people in his profession."

"After all, the one I loved kept that same distance from others herself."

"Looking up to the doctor again, I realize I've been in thought with my head bowed for some time."

"Doctor" "I understand you must still be tired. You've been through a lot, and as I mentioned before, the anaesthetic would still be affecting you."

"Doctor" "If you don't mind, I'll let you get some rest and tell your parents you've woken up for you."

"She rights herself quickly, her crying forcefully stifled with both sadness and stubbornness remaining in her moistened eyes. Her prideful nature, always having been something to contend with, takes me off guard."

li "Stop telling me not to worry about you, Hisao!"

li "Just this once… let me cry…"

"I'm caught speechless. She waits for a response, but her composure breaks again after a handful of seconds."

"I swallow hard to try and settle my own emotions while she weeps onto my bed, a strange mixture of relief and depression welling up."

"Lilly's… here. She's really here. If I couldn't feel her skin under my hand, I'd hardly believe my own eyes. My efforts weren't for nothing; my body's attempt to take away everything that was important to me once again has been foiled."

"But now… I don't feel as happy about it as I thought I would."

"Seeing her here, crying like this over me… this is the one thing I'd wanted to avoid since coming to love her, no, even since leaving the hospital."

hi "I'm sorry, Lilly. It's my fault I'm here; I shouldn't have tried to push myself so far."

"I give a self-deprecating snort."

hi "After months of keeping myself together so nobody'd worry over me, I went and did something like this. I guess I'm pretty dumb."

"With a couple of sniffs and a long breath, Lilly manages to pull herself together and calm down a little."

"Despite her red cheeks, moist eyes and the lines of her tears still visible, she delicately wears that weak smile she seemed to so often give."

li "You needn't blame yourself. I heard later that it happened as you were running down the road after me, right?"

hi "Still…"

"She wipes her eyes with the back of her hand, returning more to her old self as the rush of emotions wears off."

li "Sorry?"

hi "For the times when I wasn't there when you needed me."

hi "Why didn't you say that you wanted to go?"

li "I—"

hi "I'm not stubborn often, but this one time I think I need to be. I want you to stay here, Lilly."

hi "I want you to stay where everyone you know lives, and where all your dreams and ambitions were made. If you choose to stay, I'll never leave your side. I won't let you lose another person."

hi "When I had my heart attack, I was snatched away from everyone and everywhere I knew. You showed me a new life after I came to Yamaku. I'd lost my past, but you showed me a future."

hi "It's true that I haven't always been there for you. I'm unreliable, sometimes I lied, and I thought I'd come to understand you when I hadn't even understood myself."

hi "Be that as it may, I want to give you a future as well. I want to be there for you, to share both your burdens and your happiness, just like I promised back in Hokkaido."

hi "I want you to trust me. I know I had problems coming to put my trust in you, after losing so many people I'd known after my heart attack, but that's how I know that being unable to trust others can feel awful."

hi "That's why I can't watch you just throw everything away like this. I never want you to go through what I did. I would do anything to stop that."

li "You can be quite steadfast when you want to be, can't you?"

"Lilly's face tenses as I let out a small gasp of pain, immediately making me wish I'd stifled it better. All I can do is sigh in defeat."

hi "I tried to not let anyone worry over me for the entire time since I left the hospital, but I can't even stop the one person I love most from crying over me."

hi "Even if I might finally be able to put my feelings into words, I feel pretty useless with a body like this."

hi "Every time I tried to reach towards something, it was just snatched away, and even now things only turned out for the better due to luck."

hi "I guess that's something else I should apologize for. All I can ever do is make you worry. Even now, there's very little chance I'll live anywhere near a full life."

"The feeling of Lilly's warm, soft hand moving over my left cheek makes me lift my head up, her smile gentle and warm as she touches me."

li "You are a very beautiful person, Hisao. Your heart changes none of that, so please, don't apologize for yourself any more."

"For a long time, silence reigns in the room."

"I'm not really sure what this newly born feeling inside of me is, but it pales into insignificance as I wordlessly gaze at Lilly's smiling face, warm and gentle as it has always been."

"It's only as her thumb crosses my cheek, wiping away a single drop of moisture, that I realize this is all I've ever wanted."

"For what feels like the first time, I give an earnest, wide smile. As Lilly feels it against her palm, she returns the gesture."

"More time passes before either of us says a word, neither of us needing speech to communicate our feelings to each other."

hi "I know I can't promise you that I'll always be around, or that we'll be together forever."

"With some difficulty I slowly lift my hand, placing it on her pale shoulder."

hi "But… I think I can at least take you to next year's Tanabata festival, to make up for making you miss this year's."
