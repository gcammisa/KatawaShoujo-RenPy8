"But I have other reasons than that for my coming here so often, and I don't feel so bad about losing that part of myself because of them. Lilly is a good friend by now, but it's the small exchanges I have with Hanako that feel especially dear."

"The small victories I feel every day as I see more of what she's like under her self-imposed shell. That's why I come here most of all."

"As I'm putting away cups and saucers, I hear talking outside the door. Pausing for a moment to listen, I can make out that it's Hanako and Lilly, and decide to go outside to investigate."

"I know that Hanako can see everyone staring at our group. Specifically, at her. Because they know that if there's a problem, it has to be her."

"Everyone knows her, and it's the first thing anyone's mind would leap to. Her reputation for being a truant has marked her as an unusual person, even in unusual Yamaku."
