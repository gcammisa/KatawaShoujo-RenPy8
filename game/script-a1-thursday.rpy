"The sound of an alarm pulls me out of a fitful slumber and into the unpleasant state of wakefulness."

"I linger under the blanket for a few minutes, gathering energy to rise up while making excuses as for why I already haven't."

"Honestly, I wouldn't mind staying here for all day. School is surprisingly exhausting after a long pause, and the culture shock still has not faded, I think."

"Still, despite getting an impression that skipping class is easy here, I don't think they are going to let me get away that easily."

"And the nurse is bound to keep breathing down my neck with the talk of exercising as well."

"So eventually I do rise up, swallow the morning medications and put on my old soccer clothing."

"Thanks to my condition, I was exempted from taking part in gym classes at Yamaku, so I didn't get issued with a gym outfit."

"I'd order some to cover such a contingency, but wearing my old soccer clothes is kind of nostalgic."

"I can't use them for that any more, so maybe they can get a new life this way. A bit like me."

"After all, if I'm going to start taking care of myself, I can't afford to slack around. I'll start from the basics."

"Basics which include keeping the rest of my body in shape along with what little I can do to strengthen my heart."

"Maybe then I can go back to something approaching a normal life; or at least something where I'm less likely to fall over dead at any minute."

"The prosthetic-legged girl who bowled me over in the hallway yesterday is running on the track lithely, like a half-mechanical gazelle."

"What was her name again? It was a short one, but I can't remember."

"She seems to be running laps at a somewhat easy lope, her prosthetic legs clacking rhythmically on the hard track surface."

"I wonder what reason she has for running this early in the morning. Maybe it's something akin to mine, and the nurse is oppressing the poor girl to jog just like he is oppressing me."

"I certainly wouldn't be here if it weren't for my health, and his prompting me to do so."

"And even with things being like they are, it's only because I wanted to get it out of the way early."

"The fact that I would be less likely to encounter someone who would witness my pitiful attempts to get in shape was merely a happy accident."

"I'd leave, but it seems that my former assailant noticed me on her last lap."

"She waves at me cheerfully and jogs over."

"The nighttime lighting really makes the gardens look quite different. Compared to the usual look of lush greenery, things are much more calm."

"Being that it's so late, the lack of students around probably helps. The odd one or two can be seen scurrying to and from the dorms trying to eke the most out of their approaching curfews, but no more."

"All that can be heard is our footsteps, in addition to Lilly's cane regularly gently tapping the ground in front of her."

"It's nice to finally be able to relax a bit after the mad rush during school."

"Without even noticing it, I let out a small yawn."

"Well, that confirms my suspicions at the time. I pissed her off."

"That said, while I may have inadvertently fed her to the dogs, I couldn't know and therefore am in no position where I'd need to apologize."

"A couple of minutes of strained silence pass by between us, Hanako's eyes darting left and right."

"Giving up on the prospect of any kind of apology, Lilly surrenders the fight and changes the topic."

"As is to be expected of such an arrangement, there's a staff member casually patrolling around outside to prevent any nighttime shenanigans."

"Walking past him, I quickly stretch my arms and rub my neck, both quite sore after having worked on the floor for so long, before walking to my room."

"It feels good to actually have direction, though. After so long in the hospital, the everyday facts of studying, homework and teachers seem almost a blessing."
