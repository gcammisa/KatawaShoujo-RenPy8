"Her focused expression gives the same feeling of being on the other side of some imaginary gap as looking at her sleeping face does."

"I feel a pain in my chest."

"There's no way I can close that gap to be on the same level with her. It hurts, even though I know that it's impossible for any two people to truly understand each other."

"But Rin… she's almost literally in another world when she's talking about art, thinking about art, or making art."

"It's a world that I - or anyone else, really - can't share with her. Just like the world of dreams."

"Rin still doesn't show any sign of waking up, so I'm faced with the decision to either rouse her myself, or wait for her to awaken on her own."

"It is the rambling, ranting, raving speech of a lunatic, even and steady in tone, but taking the form of a never-ending stream of words almost simultaneously spawning from between her lips."
