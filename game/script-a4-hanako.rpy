"I can never get used to the idea that she just doesn't show up to class every now and again. It feels all the more worrying now as well, given that Lilly's left."

"As Mutou continues to drone on, I find my gaze flicking every so often over to her seat, as if she might appear there any moment now. Nobody else seems to care at all about her absence, but they have little reason to."

"Hanako being absent from class, after all, is perfectly normal. Or at least, it was. Her attendance hasn't been all that bad from what I've seen in my time here, but it was apparently much more spotty beforehand."

"This is also an ominous time for her to be gone. It's the day before her birthday, and my suspicions are starting to rise, after the breakdown she had in class when it was mentioned."

"An increasing amount of my thoughts is taken up by how I can help her, but in the end, I feel like I can't do anything."

"There's a small amount of jostling, and people's heads are often craning around to check on what's happening up ahead, but it's pretty subdued."

"This is due, no doubt, to the very serious rules regarding such matters in this school. The same strict discipline is observed when students move in the hallways, or come to and from their dormitories and the school gate."

"While the reasons for it may be slightly off-putting, I've come to quite like this sense of order that's enforced in the school."

"There's another silence on the line, but this time it's caused by me."

"Making others worry about me is something I've very actively tried to avoid since coming to Yamaku. Indeed, even my interaction with Hanako has helped stave off any major health problems thanks to our relaxed and slow-paced lives."

hi "Sorry, I was just taken a bit off guard. Still, isn't Hanako a bigger problem at the moment?"

hi "Thank you. That helps."

"We share some smalltalk to try and lighten the atmosphere, but it feels very stilted. There's a lot I don't know about Lilly's stay in Scotland, but after such a heavy subject, I want to be alone for a bit to think."

"Compared to Hanako's situation, mine feels utterly mundane. I still have both of my parents, I had a reasonably normal childhood, and unlike many in Yamaku, my condition isn't immediately visible to the public."

"But then again… isn't this just an attempt to justify the way I've been acting towards her?"

"That may well be what our pasts were like, but when it comes to the future I still have no idea what I want to do. In school I've just concentrated on each day's work, and I've put off more and more things to cater to Hanako."

"I recall the words Mutou told me after Hanako's breakdown; about the purpose of Yamaku and my education. In hindsight, he was probably trying to push exactly the same thing."

"Just what have I been doing in the time since my heart attack? If I ever did manage to get Hanako out of her room and to open up, what then?"

"I quickly look away while covering my face with my hand. Hanako does just the same."

"Another awkward silence reigns. I hate these. At first I accepted them as just being a fact of life around Hanako, but now all they feel like is an affirmation of how little we're able to communicate."

"Some anger makes its way in the complex mixture of emotions I'm experiencing right now. I want to bridge that gap between us. Friends shouldn't have to tiptoe around each other like this."

"I speak before I can argue myself out of what I'm going to do. My scarring isn't as bad as Hanako's, and I can't possibly compare my life to hers, but I want to show her that she's not alone."

"Doing this in such a blunt manner might be the only way to get my point across."

"That's something that, until now, I had tried my hardest to ignore."

"As the minutes tick by, Hanako's gaze lingers. Her eyes look less focused on my scarring than before. The situation feels a bit different than it previously did, and makes me feel slightly uncomfortable."

"Thankfully, it's something that's very rarely come up since I entered Yamaku. I thought that it was so rare that Hanako and Lilly might not think of it at all. It turns out that I was wrong."

"Hanako silently drinks her tea while I wait for my drink, confirming that it's the right temperature with a small sip before she begins in earnest."

"I feel guilty for being the cause of an uncomfortable silence, since in the past I've been kind of hard on Hanako for those."

"Just as my heart attack redefined my life… this is the event that redefined Hanako's."

"The movement feels really unnatural, and I can feel muscles moving all over my lower body that I haven't felt moving in this way before."

"With my hands holding her legs, both of us are moving in less and less measured movements by now. The smell of Hanako fills my senses, and from this position, I'm not stressing my body quite as much."

"My sense of time seems distorted, and I feel like I'm starting to get faint from hyperventilating. I want Hanako to feel good, though, and I can't stop now that we've reached this point."

"Every time it feels like we've found a rhythm, we lose it in our movements. From the sounds she's making, I don't think this position's helped Hanako feel much better, and I don't think I'm going to be able to hold her much longer, either."

"There's very little point to getting myself worked up this early though, so I try to push such things out of my mind for now."

"I roll my head to the side to see if Hanako's where she was when I drifted off to sleep. All that's there now is an empty space on the bed, and the room beyond."
