"I run my hand along the spines of the books on the way through, feeling the individual texture of each as I glance across the titles."

"I used to do this all the time at the library at the hospital. Some things never change, I guess."

"Like the smell of a library. No matter how much care you take, the paper in books is always going to degrade with time."

"Probably, no matter which library you go into, anywhere in the world, it must have that same, musty smell."
