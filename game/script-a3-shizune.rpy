aki "Hey, even if you're depressed about it, you've got to try. You could catch the big one, for all you know. But you won't catch anything unless you do!"

"I feel that at least half of her encouragement is because if Hideaki does catch 'the big one,' she wants to be there to eat it, and having six people fishing just leads to better chances of catching something than having five."

"For the first time, she hasn't put her hands over my eyes, although now I see she has bags of her own to carry, so it's not like she could have even if she wanted to. Although I am positive she's tried before."

"Her meticulously styled curls are gone now, in favor of a much shorter, sportier look. Misha looks even happier than usual, probably because she knows she won't have to wake up at the crack of dawn every morning just to do her hair."

"When I think about it, this is perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks to sign language. Shizune said that the fact that you have to sign your words out with your hands means you have time to reflect on what you say before you say it."

"But on the other hand, it also means that what would normally just be an awkward silence becomes an insurmountable wall. I'd just blurt out something, anything, to try and dispel the tension I'm feeling right now if I could, but I can't."

"Ordinarily, I think that what would be normal would be to apologize, and maybe leave. But right now, I wonder if that is even applicable. I can't get past how guilty such an action would seem. Like I were just slinking away."

"Of course, it's not like I can just play it off like nothing happened, either. That would just be insulting to both of us. So, as much as I don't want to, I apologize quickly, so quickly I forget to sign it. Then I go back to my room."

mi "But~! Then I looked at Shicchan, and she had her back to the window and was still working on something, blocking out the rest of the world. The light was on her shoulders, like when I would put a blanket on my shoulders as a little kid."

"Misha stops for a second as if trying to hold onto the image of Shizune in her mind."

mi "Shicchan looked… hm~… It was like, Shicchan looked in a way that made me want to be with her… But it felt like it would be hard for that to happen."

mi "Wahaha~. That was~, a really~ long~ time ago. My hair was different back then, too. A little messy~? I cut it because Shicchan was always talking about it."

mi "Anyway~! I told her, right then and there; I confessed~."

mi "I was rejected~."

mi "So~, I thought that that was it, Hicchan. But Shicchan was always trying to find me, and I hated Shicchan again for it. And when I asked her why she was doing it, it was because I was her friend."

"Her cheeks have a hint of red in them. I wonder how much experience she has had with crying, that she can keep herself from doing it so well. If she didn't pause to wipe her eyes, I might never have noticed."

mi "Having Shicchan say that made me happy, but also sad, and even though she never meant to hurt me, it still hurts. Even now…"

mi "Shicchan has a way of manipulating people, Hicchan. Sometimes she wants to, and sometimes she doesn't really, but it happens anyway~. And sometimes I'm just not sure… exactly which one it is. And I feel doubt…"

mi "I just wish that Shicchan liked me instead of you. It made me wonder if I was starting to hate you and Shicchan… just a little. I… didn't like that."

hi "So you were thinking, maybe it would be better if I weren't here at all?"

mi "And missing people, and being apart from them; I'm tired of it, and don't want to think about it any more."

mi "I already did, though. So~! …I'm still really the worst kind of person. I wasn't thinking that it would be better if Hicchan had never come to this school. I was thinking… wouldn't it be better if I just died?"

hi "Yesterday, I did a stupid thing. That's probably part of the reason why I'm here right now, so I could figure out if I could maybe… make it right, somehow."

hi "That probably would have bothered me, when I was in the hospital and anyone who shut me out was dead to me. I'd forgotten all about it until recently. I got a letter, and it was all about that."

hi "I was mad. I thought, 'How can you accuse me of closing myself off from everyone and giving up? Isn't that what everyone else did to me? What else am I supposed to do? What can I do?'"

hi "Yeah, even now, I know that's how it happened, but… she was right, too. I did close myself off."
