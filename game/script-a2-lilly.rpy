"After living at Yamaku, the city seems like an entirely different world."

"No running in the halls. Calm and orderly conduct is to be used at all times in the classrooms. Students are to exit rooms after checking both directions for oncomers. Elevators are reserved for movement-impaired students. Single file on stairs."

"Compared to such strict, almost regimental, standards, the city's shopping arcade might as well be a strange country."

"While the school may have its fair share of hustle and bustle during the festival, the outside world is much different."

"It's strange. Having lived in a metropolitan city before my accident, this should feel more natural than Yamaku and the surrounding town ever could."

"Yet it feels foreign, somehow. The elevated walkways and tall buildings, each adorned with billboards taller than any three people, don't do anything to distract me from the passing crowd's reactions."
