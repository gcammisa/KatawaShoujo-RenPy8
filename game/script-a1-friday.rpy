"That said, I can't shake the feeling that she'd had this idea since I said I was coming here."

"For a person who gives an impression of being the quiet type, Rin really does use a lot of words to say things that don't need a lot to be said."

"Unsure if she's finished, I say nothing. Neither does Lilly, who seems equally robbed of words for the time being."

"I think that both of us are in fact just scared that any response might provoke her to continue."

"Our stupefied lack of reaction doesn't faze Rin at all. She keeps looking at us expectantly, a calm hint of expression on her blank face."

"It seems that most of the time, it's better to not read too deeply into what Rin is babbling about."

"Talking with Rin is like playing chess with a supercomputer who does seemingly completely random moves as if to mock everything you know about chess. It's like that, except with human interaction."

"And even if I win, it feels like losing."

"Damn, it's just like Kenji said. Even when I win, I lose. Is this the power of the girls of Yamaku?"

"…"

"I push the thought aside as too dangerous to consider further. It's probably just Kenji's anti-female propaganda getting to me during a moment of weakness."

"We could just leave her to her own devices, whatever those are… but it's late and I don't think we'll be getting any thanks if Rin is found standing here in the middle of the night."

"Which she probably will, unless she manages to remember what she was doing here in the first place."

"As for me trying to guess what might've been going on in her mind when she decided to embark on this adventure, the chances seem to be on par with winning the lottery."

"Several times in a row."

"Lilly is oddly quiet too. I'd appreciate some support from the sidelines here, especially if she's more familiar with Rin than I am."
