sa "About a hundred years ago a little known painter got news that his friend, a man called Casagemas, had committed suicide."


sa "This happened while he was away and hadn't seen his friend for a while."

sa "So obviously he must have felt even more conflicted than you normally would after hearing of such a thing."

sa "For four years after that, our main character did nothing but monochromatic paintings because he was so deeply affected by the news."

sa "Whatever he did, he always kept returning to that same color until it let him out of its grasp."

"She takes a little pause to check whether I'm still following."

"I am, to an extent, so I give her the prompt that storytellers seem to live for."

hi "So…"

"It's hard to continue from that, as I can't seem to come up with the question she wants me to come up with."

"It almost makes me laugh."

"The carefree easiness of her gesture is a lovely thing, a sign of how Rin can, truly and really, without any restraints whatsoever, shed the entire weight of the world from her shoulders, should she will so."

"She is, in every possible and probably a few impossible ways… free."

"And I think I might love her for that."

"She takes five steps to climb on a large rock so she can rise as high as it's possible here, and stands on tiptoes."

"When you reach for the clouds, every inch counts."

hi "Sure, let's watch the clouds. It's good to do something you really want to do, every now and then."

rin "Yeah. You are probably right."

"I glance upwards at the blue sky opening high above us."

"It's a deep, cerulean vastness that spreads to fill my entire field of vision and beyond."

"Yet Rin stays on her rock, peering at the distant horizon where the rain clouds are drifting farther away from us."

rin "I have decided something."

"That dreaming voice of hers, spoken to the wind that carries it to my ears, is lacking resolve in tone but is full of it in meaning."

rin "It's all right to be me after all."

n "Well, I suppose that is an important realization."

n "Coming to terms with oneself, accepting yourself, being fine with what you are."

n "A simple resolution of heart that for some people is overbearingly hard to do, if not impossible."

n "I do realize well enough that I might also be one of those people."

n "Rin too… "

n "Maybe we are not that different after all."

n "Maybe to accept someone else, you must first accept yourself."

n "Maybe that is a necessary step, which we didn't take until now."

"The wind catches her hair and clothes, and Rin spreads her short arms into an embrace that is so very very tiny, but as wide as she can ever do."

"For a moment it looks like she herself might take flight, and I have to hold myself back to not reach for her shoulder, to not drag her back to me."

"But this picture is something I can only watch, it is something for me to remember."

"Rin's sleeves are flapping freely in the wind, her hair wildly tousled by it, her skin touched by the setting sun."

"Her sleek form that I've come to adore is quivering in the cool wind that carries the small white specks past her, each a beginning of a new flower."

"All that is engraved inside my heart."

"Like those tiny seeds scattered into the wind, I'm sure that Rin too can take her place in this world without the need to create her own inside of it."

"Maybe she believes it too, and standing as close to heaven as possible, she is giving the world a big hug."

"To me it seems like the entire world really could fit there, between those small arms of hers, inside of her all-encompassing embrace."
