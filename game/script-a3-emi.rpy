"With her eyes closed, her lips purse expectantly. I just manage to lift myself up for a few moments. Our mouths seeking one another, her chest sliding against mine as our sweat mingles."

"As I flop back down, my trousers are soaked with sweat. I would take them off if it didn't mean stopping what we're doing."

"And I don't want to stop what we're doing, stop this growing pressure, this tickling in the back of my brain."
