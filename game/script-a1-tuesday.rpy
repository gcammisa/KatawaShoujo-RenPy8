"My room…"

"This is the third room this year that I'm supposed to call 'mine.'"

"Various things around here remind me that indeed, it's me who is supposed to be the one living here."

"My bags on the floor, my new school books on the desk."

"My numerous medications on the night table."

"I stare at the bottles for a moment, deliberating, until I open a bottle, shake out a pill and pop out a tablet from a foil sheet."

"I down them with a chaser of water without thinking about the chemistry."

"My uniforms are in the closet."

"I slink out from under the sheets and stretch my back before dressing up."

"Putting on a new school uniform feels like dressing in someone else's clothes."

"The artificial smell of generic detergent invades my nose, but the feeling of fresh cloth against my back is a good one, a natural one."

"It feels like a school uniform, as it should. It's not much different from what I used to wear before."

"That goes for other things too. So far, this place seems more or less like a normal school."

"Except for the people."

"I think back to my talk with Kenji yesterday, Misha's constant laughter, and Shizune's sweeping sign language gestures."

"Well, I've only met three students so far. Maybe they aren't that normal, but I'm sure others are."

"Or, perhaps, people like them are what passes for normal around here?"

"Yeah, what does pass for normal around here? What do people do?"

"I didn't see a lot of kids hanging around after classes yesterday, so maybe there are clubs. If so, I wonder if I should join one."
